# Security and Responsible Disclosure Policy

_Submit a vulnerability:_ Unfortunately, we cannot accept secure submissions via
email or via GitHub Issues. Please use our website to submit vulnerabilities at
[https://hhs.responsibledisclosure.com](https://hhs.responsibledisclosure.com).
HHS maintains an acknowledgements page to recognize your efforts on behalf of
the American public, but you are also welcome to submit anonymously.

Review the HHS Disclosure Policy and websites in scope:
[https://www.hhs.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/index.html).

This policy describes _what systems and types of research_ are covered under this
policy, _how to send_ us vulnerability reports, and _how long_ we ask security
researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.

If you have other cybersecurity related questions, please contact us at
